## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am using the BEM methodology as much as possible. I find it easier with class names and make the CSS easier to read and will use it in future projects. I tried to keep the code as clean as possible and also tried out the Calc function for all the spacing. I don't know if that is the best solution, but I did it for practicing with calc.

### Continued development

I still need more practice with CSS Grid. I am also trying to think of accessibility with every project.

### Useful resources
